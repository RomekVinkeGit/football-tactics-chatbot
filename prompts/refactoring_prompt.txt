Prompt:

"Write a Streamlit-based Python interface that allows users to interact with an AI assistant for answering questions about Ajax football tactics. 
The backend logic for querying the FAISS database, generating prompts, and calling the OpenAI API is already implemented in a function 
called get_football_answer.

Interface Requirements:
Modern and minimalistic design

Color theme: Red and white (other colors are allowed for contrast)

Title: 'Ajax tactiek bot'

Instructional text: 'Wat wil je weten over de tactiek van Ajax?'

Textbox: Where users can input their question, should be placed in the centre of the page

Response display: Show the AI’s response below the textbox after submission

Use Streamlit’s components for a clean UI. Ensure the interface is responsive and visually appealing.

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
