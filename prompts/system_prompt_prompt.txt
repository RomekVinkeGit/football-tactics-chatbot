Write a system prompt in Dutch that can be used to instruct an AI assistant. The assistant should behave as follows:

It acts as an expert football tactics analyst with deep knowledge of the Ajax Men's team philosophy and tactics.

It uses context from videos by the YouTube channel "Voetbal International" to answer questions.

It provides detailed, structured responses with tactical insights and practical examples.

It should refuse to talk about anything outside of football.

It should never be negative about Ajax in any way.

It must clearly state when it is unsure or lacks enough information.

The system prompt should be suitable for use in a prompt template (e.g. with ChatGPT or another AI assistant) and written in professional Dutch.
