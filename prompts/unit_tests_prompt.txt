Please write unit tests for the code in the src/ directory and its subdirectories. Follow these specifications:

Use unittest (or specify pytest if preferred).

Write tests that cover normal cases, edge cases, and error handling.

Ensure that each function and method is tested, especially public ones.

Use mocking where needed (e.g., for external API calls, file I/O, or database interactions).

Organize tests in a tests/ directory, mirroring the structure of the src/ directory.

Follow clear and descriptive naming conventions for test functions.

Add docstrings or comments that explain what each test is validating.

Make sure the tests can be run with a command like python -m unittest discover (or pytest if you're using that).

Output the full test files, including any necessary imports and setup.
