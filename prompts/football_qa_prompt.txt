Prompt:

"Write a Python module that generates a prompt for an OpenAI API call based on a user’s question and contextual knowledge retrieved from a FAISS vector database. The FAISS database contains information about football tactics extracted from Dutch YouTube videos.

The module should follow these steps:

Retrieve relevant context – Query the FAISS vector database using similarity search with a given user question. Retrieve the top k most relevant text chunks.

Generate a prompt – Combine:

The user’s question

The retrieved context

A system instruction to ensure accurate and context-based responses

Call the OpenAI API – Use gpt-4o-mini to generate a response based on the constructed prompt.

Format the response – Ensure the output is detailed, structured, and removes unnecessary line breaks.

The module should be implemented as a function that accepts:

A FAISS database instance

A user query

An optional parameter k for the number of retrieved context chunks

Use langchain for the prompt template

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
